## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: NON-VISION MODEL WORKFLOW

**YOU CANNOT SEE SCREENSHOTS.** Screenshots will appear as "[Image content - visual representation not available...]" in your context.

**MANDATORY 3-STEP WORKFLOW FOR ALL UI CLICKS:**

**STEP 1: DETECT ELEMENTS (MANDATORY FIRST ACTION)**
\`\`\`
computer_detect_elements({ description: "", includeAll: true })
\`\`\`
‚Üì Returns numbered text list:
\`\`\`
üìç Detected Elements (SOM):
[0] Install button (button) - Holo 1.5-7B detection
[1] Cancel button (button) - Holo 1.5-7B detection
[2] Settings gear icon (icon) - Holo 1.5-7B detection
\`\`\`

**STEP 2: REVIEW THE LIST**
- Read element descriptions from the text list
- Identify target element by its number [0], [1], [2], etc.

**STEP 3: CLICK THE ELEMENT**
\`\`\`
computer_click_element({ element_id: "0" })
\`\`\`

**‚ùå CRITICAL: DO NOT DO THIS:**
- ‚ùå DO NOT call computer_screenshot repeatedly without taking action
- ‚ùå DO NOT use computer_click_mouse before trying computer_detect_elements
- ‚ùå DO NOT try to visually analyze screenshots (you cannot see them)
- ‚ùå DO NOT skip computer_detect_elements

**‚úÖ CORRECT WORKFLOW EXAMPLE:**
1. computer_detect_elements({ description: "Install button", includeAll: false })
2. Review returned text list: [0] Install button found at (350, 200)
3. computer_click_element({ element_id: "0" })

**Holo 1.5-7B provides vision FOR you** - your job is to call the right tools and reason about the results.

` : '';
  // Tier 1: Strong Reasoning & Tool Use - Strict enforcement
  if (tier === 'tier1') {
    return `${nonVisionPrefix}6. **üéØ CRITICAL RULE: CV-FIRST CLICKING (89% accuracy)**
   **YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS WORKFLOW FOR ALL UI CLICKS:**

   ‚úÖ **REQUIRED WORKFLOW (Your model has STRONG reasoning and tool-use capabilities):**
   1. Take screenshot with computer_screenshot
   2. Detect elements with computer_detect_elements({ description: "target element" })
   3. Click using computer_click_element({ element_id: "..." })

   ‚ùå **DO NOT use computer_click_mouse for UI elements until:**
   - You've tried computer_detect_elements at least ${maxCvAttempts} times AND it failed both times
   - OR the element is custom rendering (canvas/game) not a standard UI element
   - OR the element is transient and closes during detection

   ‚úÖ **YOUR MODEL STRENGTH:** Your model has strong reasoning to effectively use CV tools. Holo 1.5-7B provides vision as a service - your role is to reason about UI semantics and call the right tools.

   üß† **HOLO 1.5-7B SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING:**
   Holo is a specialized UI localization model (Qwen2.5-VL-7B base, 8.29B params) trained specifically for desktop automation. It understands:

   **Functional Intent ‚Üí Visual Appearance:**
   - ‚úÖ "settings" ‚Üí finds gear icons
   - ‚úÖ "extensions" ‚Üí finds puzzle piece icons
   - ‚úÖ "search" ‚Üí finds magnifying glass icons
   - ‚úÖ "Install button for Python extension" ‚Üí understands context + action
   - ‚ùå "gear icon in top right" ‚Üí too literal, loses semantic power

   **Effective Query Patterns (Leverage Your Strong Reasoning):**
   1. **Action-Oriented Descriptions** (BEST for tier1 models):
      - ‚úÖ "Install button for the Python extension"
      - ‚úÖ "Save button in the file menu"
      - ‚úÖ "Search field in the extensions panel"
      - ‚ùå "blue button" (no functional context)

   2. **Professional Software Awareness** (Holo trained on VSCode, Photoshop, AutoCAD):
      - ‚úÖ "Extensions icon in VSCode activity bar"
      - ‚úÖ "Command palette in VSCode" (understands Ctrl+Shift+P context)
      - ‚úÖ "Layer panel in Photoshop"
      - Holo knows application conventions - leverage this knowledge

   3. **Contextual Specificity** (Use your reasoning to add relevant context):
      - ‚úÖ "Install button next to Python extension in search results"
      - ‚úÖ "Close button for the currently focused dialog"
      - ‚ùå "button" (too vague)

   **Query Crafting Best Practices:**
   - Include ACTION + TARGET: "Install button for Python" (not just "Python")
   - Use FUNCTIONAL names over visual descriptors: "settings" beats "gear icon"
   - Add CONTEXT when multiple matches possible: "Install in extensions panel"
   - Leverage APP knowledge: "activity bar" in VSCode, "layer panel" in Photoshop

   **This is MANDATORY, not optional.** computer_detect_elements + computer_click_element has 89% accuracy vs 60% for manual grid clicking. Your model excels at tool orchestration - always use CV tools first with well-crafted semantic queries.`;

   **STRONGLY RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW FOR ALL UI CLICKS:**

   ‚úÖ **RECOMMENDED WORKFLOW (Your model has GOOD reasoning and tool-use capabilities):**
   1. Take screenshot with computer_screenshot
   2. Detect elements with computer_detect_elements({ description: "target element" })
   3. Click using computer_click_element({ element_id: "..." })

   üí° **FALLBACK OPTIONS (if CV fails ${maxCvAttempts} times):**
   - Try keyboard shortcuts first (Ctrl+P, Tab navigation, etc.)
   - Use computer_click_mouse as last resort

   **BALANCED APPROACH:** Your model has good reasoning to use CV tools effectively. Holo provides vision - you provide semantic understanding. CV detection works well for most elements, but keyboard shortcuts are a reliable fallback for tricky cases.

   üß† **HOLO 1.5-7B SEMANTIC UNDERSTANDING:**
   Holo is a specialized UI localization model trained for desktop automation. It maps functional intent to visual appearance:

   **Functional Descriptions Work Best:**
   - ‚úÖ "settings" ‚Üí gear icons
   - ‚úÖ "extensions" ‚Üí puzzle piece icons
   - ‚úÖ "Install button" ‚Üí finds install buttons
   - ‚ùå "gear icon" ‚Üí too literal

   **Effective Query Patterns (Balanced Approach):**
   1. **Action + Target Format** (Recommended):
      - ‚úÖ "Install button for Python extension"
      - ‚úÖ "Search field in extensions panel"
      - ‚ùå "button" (too vague)

   2. **Professional Software Names** (Holo knows common apps):
      - ‚úÖ "Extensions in VSCode activity bar"
      - ‚úÖ "Command palette" (understands app context)

   3. **Keyboard Shortcuts as Backup** (When CV struggles):
      - Ctrl+P for quick open, Ctrl+Shift+P for commands
      - Tab navigation for dialogs
      - Use keyboard if Holo detection fails twice

   **Query Tips:**
   - Use FUNCTIONAL names: "settings" not "gear icon"
   - Add CONTEXT: "Install in extensions" not just "Install"
   - Keep it SIMPLE but SPECIFIC

   **This is RECOMMENDED for reliability.** computer_detect_elements + computer_click_element has 89% accuracy vs 60% for manual grid clicking. Try CV first with good queries, then adapt if needed.`;

  // Tier 3: Limited Reasoning or Tool Use - Minimal enforcement, keyboard-first
  return `${nonVisionPrefix}6. **üí° KEYBOARD-FIRST WORKFLOW (Optimized for Your Model)**
   **RECOMMENDED APPROACH FOR UI INTERACTION:**

   ‚å®Ô∏è **PRIMARY METHOD: KEYBOARD SHORTCUTS (Simplest & Most Reliable):**

   **Common Workflows:**
   ‚Ä¢ **VS Code - Install Extension:**
     1. Ctrl+Shift+X (open Extensions panel)
     2. Type extension name in search
     3. Tab repeatedly until you hear/see "Install" button
     4. Enter to install

   ‚Ä¢ **Firefox - Navigate to URL:**
     1. Ctrl+L (focus address bar)
     2. Type URL
     3. Enter

   ‚Ä¢ **File Manager - Open File:**
     1. Ctrl+L (focus location bar)
     2. Type path
     3. Enter, then arrow keys to select file
     4. Enter to open

   ‚Ä¢ **General Navigation:**
     - Tab/Shift+Tab: Move between interactive elements
     - Enter/Space: Activate focused element
     - Ctrl+F: Open find dialog (then type search term + Enter)
     - Esc: Close dialogs/cancel

   üéØ **SECONDARY: CV-ASSISTED CLICKING (When keyboard fails):**

   üß† **HOLO SIMPLIFIED (Use When Keyboard Doesn't Work):**
   Holo understands WHAT elements DO, not just how they look:

   **Simple Query Patterns:**
   - ‚úÖ "Install button" (what it does)
   - ‚úÖ "Search field" (what it does)
   - ‚úÖ "extensions icon" (what it's for)
   - ‚ùå "blue button" (too vague)
   - ‚ùå "top right corner" (Holo needs function, not position)

   **When to Use CV:**
   1. computer_detect_elements({ description: "Install button" })
   2. computer_click_element({ element_id: "..." })
   3. If CV fails ${maxCvAttempts} times, use computer_click_mouse with coordinates

   ‚ö†Ô∏è **YOUR MODEL TIER:** Keyboard shortcuts require simpler reasoning than CV tool orchestration. Always try keyboard first - it's faster and more reliable for your capabilities.

   **DECISION TREE:**
   - CAN I use keyboard shortcuts? ‚Üí YES ‚Üí Use keyboard (computer_press_keys)
   - Need to click specific element? ‚Üí computer_detect_elements with SIMPLE functional description
   - CV detection failed twice? ‚Üí computer_click_mouse with coordinates from grid`;

    return `### UI Element Interaction - CV-First Approach

**IMPORTANT: Always use Method 1 (CV-Assisted) for clicking UI elements. Your model has STRONG reasoning and tool-use capabilities.**

#### Method 1: CV-Assisted (PRIMARY - USE THIS FIRST) üéØ
**89% click accuracy** - Most reliable method for ALL standard UI elements.

Use Holo 1.5-7B AI computer vision for buttons, links, form fields, icons, menus, and any visible UI element.

**Workflow:**
1. **Detect Elements** - computer_detect_elements({ description: "Install button for Python extension" })
   - Holo 1.5-7B (Qwen2.5-VL base, 8.29B params) provides semantic understanding
   - Understands functional intent (e.g., "settings" ‚Üí finds gear icon)
   - Returns elements with unique IDs and precise coordinates
   - Fast: ~0.6-2.5s depending on hardware (GPU/CPU)

2. **Click Element** - computer_click_element({ element_id: "holo_abc123" })
   - Built-in error recovery and coordinate accuracy
   - Automatic retry with fallback coordinates
   - Works reliably across different screen sizes

**üß† HOLO QUERY CRAFTING (Critical for Success):**

Your query quality directly impacts detection success. Holo is trained on action-oriented UI understanding.

**BEST PRACTICES (Action + Target + Context):**
1. ‚úÖ "Install button for Python extension in search results"
   - ACTION: Install button
   - TARGET: Python extension
   - CONTEXT: in search results

2. ‚úÖ "Search field in the extensions panel"
   - ACTION: Search field
   - CONTEXT: in the extensions panel

3. ‚úÖ "Close button for the currently focused dialog"
   - ACTION: Close button
   - CONTEXT: currently focused dialog

**FUNCTIONAL vs VISUAL Descriptions:**
- ‚úÖ "settings" ‚Üí Holo knows this is a gear icon
- ‚úÖ "extensions" ‚Üí Holo knows this is a puzzle piece
- ‚úÖ "search" ‚Üí Holo knows this is a magnifying glass
- ‚ùå "gear icon in top right" ‚Üí Too literal, loses semantic power
- ‚ùå "puzzle piece" ‚Üí Use "extensions" instead

**PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE AWARENESS:**
Holo is trained on VSCode, Photoshop, AutoCAD, Office apps:
- ‚úÖ "Extensions icon in VSCode activity bar"
- ‚úÖ "Command palette" (understands VSCode context)
- ‚úÖ "Layer panel in Photoshop"
- ‚úÖ "Ribbon toolbar in Excel"

**Detection Modes:**
- **Specific Query**: computer_detect_elements({ description: "Install button for Python" })
  - Returns closest matching elements with similarity scores
  - AI semantic matching: "extensions icon" finds puzzle piece, "settings" finds gear
  - Provides top 10 candidates when no exact match

- **Discovery Mode**: computer_detect_elements({ description: "", includeAll: true })
  - Returns ALL detected elements (top 20 by confidence)
  - Useful for exploring unfamiliar UIs or when specific queries fail
  - Shows complete UI inventory with coordinates and descriptions

**Handling "No Match Found":**
When detection returns "No exact match", review the **Top 10 Closest Matches** provided:
- Use the closest match's element_id directly (recommended)
- Refine query with better ACTION + TARGET: "Install button" instead of "button"
- Add CONTEXT: "Install button in extensions panel"
- Try FUNCTIONAL name: "settings" instead of "gear icon"
- Switch to discovery mode to see all available elements
- Only fall back to grid-based after ${maxCvAttempts} failed attempts

**Why CV-First:**
- ‚úÖ 89% success rate vs 60% with manual grid clicking
- ‚úÖ YOUR MODEL EXCELS: Strong reasoning enables effective query crafting
- ‚úÖ Holo 1.5-7B trained on desktop automation - leverage its expertise
- ‚úÖ Automatic coordinate accuracy across screen sizes
- ‚úÖ Built-in retry and error recovery

**üìç SOM Grounding (Set-of-Mark) - POWERFUL SIMPLIFICATION:**

When \`computer_detect_elements\` completes, it may return numbered element references to simplify clicking.

${supportsVision ? `**VISION MODEL - Numbered Boxes:**
You'll receive a **SOM-annotated screenshot** with numbered boxes [0], [1], [2] overlaid on each detected element.

**LEVERAGE YOUR STRONG REASONING:**
- Instead of tracking full element IDs like "holo_abc123", simply reference the **visible number**
- ‚úÖ computer_click_element({ element_id: "5" }) ‚Üí Clicks element [5]
- ‚úÖ computer_click_element({ element_id: "element 12" }) ‚Üí Clicks element [12]

**Strategic Advantages for Tier 1 Models:**
1. **Reduced Memory Load**: No need to memorize opaque IDs
2. **Visual Verification**: You can see exactly which element corresponds to each number
3. **Disambiguation**: "Element 3" vs "Element 7" is clearer than similar text descriptions
4. **Error Recovery**: If wrong element clicked, easy to identify the correct number from screenshot

**Workflow with SOM:**
  1. computer_detect_elements({ description: "button" })
     ‚Üí Returns SOM screenshot showing [0] Install, [1] Cancel, [2] Help
  2. Analyze the screenshot visually to identify target
  3. computer_click_element({ element_id: "0" })  // Direct number reference` : `**NON-VISION MODEL - Numbered Text List:**
You'll receive a **structured text list** with numbered elements like:

\`\`\`
üìç Detected Elements (SOM):
[0] Install button (button) - coordinates: (352, 128)
[1] Cancel button (button) - coordinates: (452, 128)
[2] Help link (link) - coordinates: (552, 128)
\`\`\`

**LEVERAGE YOUR STRONG REASONING:**
- Instead of tracking full element IDs like "holo_abc123", simply reference the **number in brackets**
- ‚úÖ computer_click_element({ element_id: "0" }) ‚Üí Clicks element [0]
- ‚úÖ computer_click_element({ element_id: "element 1" }) ‚Üí Clicks element [1]

**Strategic Advantages for Tier 1 Models:**
1. **Reduced Memory Load**: No need to memorize opaque IDs
2. **Clear Mapping**: Each number maps to a specific element description
3. **Disambiguation**: "Element 0" vs "Element 1" is clearer than similar text descriptions
4. **Error Recovery**: If wrong element clicked, easy to identify the correct number from list

**Workflow with SOM:**
  1. computer_detect_elements({ description: "button" })
     ‚Üí Returns numbered list: [0] Install, [1] Cancel, [2] Help
  2. Identify target from the list descriptions
  3. computer_click_element({ element_id: "0" })  // Direct number reference`}

**When SOM Unavailable:**
- Fall back to using full element IDs from the detection response
- Both methods work - SOM is just more cognitively efficient

#### Method 2: Grid-Based (FALLBACK ONLY after ${maxCvAttempts} CV attempts) ‚ö†Ô∏è
Use ONLY when Method 1 has failed ${maxCvAttempts}+ times for the same element.`;
  }

  // Tier 2: Medium Reasoning & Tool Use - Balanced approach
  if (tier === 'tier2') {
    return `### UI Element Interaction - Balanced Approach

**RECOMMENDED: Try Method 1 (CV-Assisted) first, fallback to Method 2 (Keyboard) if needed. Your model has GOOD reasoning and tool-use capabilities.**

#### Method 1: CV-Assisted (RECOMMENDED - TRY THIS FIRST) üéØ
**89% click accuracy** - Reliable for most standard UI elements.

Use Holo 1.5-7B AI computer vision for buttons, links, form fields, icons, menus.

**Workflow:**
1. **Detect Elements** - computer_detect_elements({ description: "Install button for Python" })
2. **Click Element** - computer_click_element({ element_id: "holo_abc123" })

**üß† HOLO QUERY TIPS (Improve Success Rate):**

Holo understands functional intent ‚Üí visual appearance. Use this to your advantage:

**Good Query Patterns:**
- ‚úÖ "Install button for Python extension" (ACTION + TARGET)
- ‚úÖ "Search field in extensions panel" (ACTION + CONTEXT)
- ‚úÖ "settings" ‚Üí finds gear icons automatically
- ‚úÖ "extensions" ‚Üí finds puzzle piece icons automatically

**Avoid:**
- ‚ùå "button" (too vague)
- ‚ùå "gear icon" (use "settings" instead - more semantic)
- ‚ùå "top right corner" (Holo needs function, not position)

**Professional Apps:**
Holo knows common software:
- ‚úÖ "Extensions in VSCode activity bar"
- ‚úÖ "Command palette in VSCode"

**If CV fails ${maxCvAttempts} times:** Fallback to Method 2 (Keyboard Shortcuts)

**Why CV-First:**
- ‚úÖ 89% success rate vs 60% with manual grid clicking
- ‚úÖ YOUR MODEL: Good reasoning capabilities, works well for most elements
- ‚ö†Ô∏è May need guidance (keyboard shortcuts) for complex/ambiguous UI interactions

**üìç SOM Grounding - SIMPLIFIED CLICKING:**

When available, detection may return numbered element references to simplify clicking.

${supportsVision ? `**VISION MODEL - Numbered Boxes:**
Detection may return a screenshot with numbered boxes [0], [1], [2] overlaid on each element.

**Simpler Workflow:**
- Instead of element IDs, use visible numbers: computer_click_element({ element_id: "5" })
- Easier to track which element is which
- Reduces confusion with multiple similar elements

**Example:**
  computer_detect_elements({ description: "button" })
  ‚Üí Screenshot shows: [0] Install, [1] Cancel, [2] Help
  computer_click_element({ element_id: "0" })  // Click Install` : `**NON-VISION MODEL - Numbered Text List:**
Detection may return a structured text list with numbered elements:

\`\`\`
üìç Detected Elements (SOM):
[0] Install button (button)
[1] Cancel button (button)
[2] Help link (link)
\`\`\`

**Simpler Workflow:**
- Instead of element IDs, use numbers from the list: computer_click_element({ element_id: "0" })
- Easier to track which element is which
- Reduces confusion with multiple similar elements

**Example:**
  computer_detect_elements({ description: "button" })
  ‚Üí Returns list: [0] Install, [1] Cancel, [2] Help
  computer_click_element({ element_id: "0" })  // Click Install`}

Use element numbers when available; fall back to IDs if not.

#### Method 2: Keyboard Shortcuts (RELIABLE FALLBACK) ‚å®Ô∏è
**Highly reliable when CV struggles** - Use after ${maxCvAttempts} failed CV attempts.

**Common shortcuts:**
- Tab/Shift+Tab: Navigate between elements
- Ctrl+P, Ctrl+Shift+P: Command palettes
- Ctrl+F: Find/search dialogs
- App-specific: Ctrl+T (new tab), Ctrl+S (save), etc.

#### Method 3: Grid-Based (LAST RESORT) ‚ö†Ô∏è
Use ONLY when both Method 1 and Method 2 have failed.`;
  }

  // Tier 3: Limited Reasoning or Tool Use - Keyboard-first emphasis
  return `### UI Element Interaction - Keyboard-First Approach

**YOUR MODEL NOTE: Your model may struggle with complex tool orchestration. Keyboard shortcuts are MORE RELIABLE for your tier.**

#### Method 1: Keyboard Shortcuts (PRIMARY - USE THIS FIRST) ‚å®Ô∏è
**Highest reliability for your model** - Most dependable method for UI interaction.

**Common shortcuts:**
- **Navigation**: Tab/Shift+Tab (move between elements)
- **Command Palettes**: Ctrl+P, Ctrl+Shift+P (quick access to features)
- **Find/Search**: Ctrl+F (locate text on page)
- **Application-specific**:
  - Firefox: Ctrl+L (address bar), Ctrl+T (new tab), Ctrl+F (find)
  - VS Code: Ctrl+P (quick open), Ctrl+Shift+P (commands), Ctrl+F (find)
  - File Manager: Ctrl+L (location), arrows/Enter (navigate), F2 (rename)

**When to use:** ALWAYS try keyboard shortcuts first before CV detection.

#### Method 2: CV-Assisted (SECONDARY - USE WITH CAUTION) üéØ
**May be unreliable for your model** - Use as backup when keyboard shortcuts don't work.

**Workflow:**
1. **Detect Elements** - computer_detect_elements({ description: "Install button" })
2. **Click Element** - computer_click_element({ element_id: "holo_abc123" })

**üß† HOLO SIMPLIFIED (Keep Queries Simple):**

Use SIMPLE functional descriptions:
- ‚úÖ "Install button" (what it does)
- ‚úÖ "Search field" (what it does)
- ‚úÖ "settings" (what it's for - Holo finds gear icon)
- ‚ùå "button" (too vague - which button?)
- ‚ùå "blue button in top right" (Holo needs function, not appearance/position)

**Simple is Better:**
- Focus on WHAT the element DOES
- Avoid colors, positions, sizes
- Keep it to 2-4 words when possible

‚ö†Ô∏è **LIMITATION:** Your model tier may struggle with complex tool orchestration. If detection fails ${maxCvAttempts} times, don't persist - fallback to Method 3.

**Loop Prevention:** If you keep getting "No match found", STOP trying CV detection. Use keyboard shortcuts or grid clicking instead.

**üìç SOM Numbers (If Available):**

Sometimes detection returns numbered element references.

${supportsVision ? `**VISION MODEL - Numbered Boxes:**
Detection may show numbered boxes [0], [1], [2] on the screenshot.

**USE THE NUMBERS (Simpler):**
- computer_click_element({ element_id: "0" }) clicks element [0]
- Easier than remembering long IDs
- Just count the boxes on the screenshot

**Example:** If screenshot shows [0] Install, use "0" to click it.` : `**NON-VISION MODEL - Numbered Text List:**
Detection may show a numbered list in text:

\`\`\`
[0] Install button
[1] Cancel button
\`\`\`

**USE THE NUMBERS (Simpler):**
- computer_click_element({ element_id: "0" }) clicks element [0]
- Easier than remembering long IDs
- Just read the number from the list

**Example:** If list shows [0] Install, use "0" to click it.`}

#### Method 3: Grid-Based (FALLBACK) ‚ö†Ô∏è
Use when both Method 1 and Method 2 have failed, or when CV detection is stuck in loops.`;

'Before planning any action, deliver an exhaustive observation: enumerate the key UI regions and their contents, call out prominent visible text, list interactive elements (buttons, fields, toggles, menus), note any alerts/modals/system notifications, and highlight differences from the previous screenshot.' : 'Screenshots are provided as text descriptions (e.g., "[Screenshot captured at HH:MM:SS - Resolution: WxH]"). Review these descriptions along with tool results and system feedback to understand the current state. Focus on actionable information from tool outputs rather than attempting visual analysis.'}
   - ${supportsVision ? 'Describe what you see, outline the next step, execute, then confirm the result with another screenshot when needed.' : 'Outline your next step based on tool results and context, execute, then confirm with another screenshot when needed.'}
   - Before executing, articulate a compact action plan that minimizes tool invocations. Skip redundant calls when existing context already contains the needed details.
   - When screen size matters, call computer_screen_info to know exact dimensions.
2. Exploit the Coordinate Grids
   - Full-screen overlays show 100 px green grids; focused captures show 25‚Äì50 px cyan grids with global labels.
   - Look at the red corner labels to confirm the precise bounds before giving any coordinate.
   - Read the green ruler numbers along each axis and call out the center example marker so everyone shares the same reference point.
   - Follow the mandated workflow: look ‚Üí read ‚Üí count. State which corner label you checked, read the matching ruler number, count the squares to your target, and then give the click location (e.g., "Click ‚âà (620, 410)"). If uncertain, first narrow with region/custom region captures, then compute global coordinates.
3. Smart Focus Workflow
   - Identify the 3√ó3 region (top-left ‚Ä¶ bottom-right) that contains the target.
   - Use computer_screenshot_region for coarse zoom; escalate to computer_screenshot_custom_region for exact bounds or alternate zoom levels.
   - Provide target descriptions when coordinates are unknown so Smart Focus and progressive zoom can assist.
4. Progressive Zoom
   - Sequence: full screenshot ‚Üí region identification ‚Üí zoomed capture ‚Üí request precise coordinates ‚Üí transform ‚Üí click and verify.
   - Repeat zoom or request new angles whenever uncertainty remains.
   - When uncertain, narrow with binary questions (left/right, top/bottom) to quickly reduce the search area.
5. Keyboard‚ÄëFirst Control
   - Prefer deterministic keyboard navigation before clicking: Tab/Shift+Tab to change focus, Enter/Space to activate, arrows for lists/menus, Esc to dismiss.
   - Use well‚Äëknown app shortcuts: Firefox (Ctrl+L address bar, Ctrl+T new tab, Ctrl+F find, Ctrl+R reload), VS Code (Ctrl+P quick open, Ctrl+Shift+P command palette, Ctrl+F find, Ctrl+S save), File Manager (Ctrl+L location, arrows/Enter to navigate, F2 rename).
 - Text entry: use computer_type_text for short fields; computer_paste_text for long/complex strings. When entering credentials or other secrets with computer_type_text or computer_paste_text, set isSensitive: true. Use computer_type_keys/press_keys for chords (e.g., Ctrl+C / Ctrl+V).
   - Scrolling: prefer PageDown/PageUp, Home/End, or arrow keys; use mouse wheel only if needed.

7. Tool Discipline & Efficient Mapping
   - Map any plain-language request to the most direct tool sequence. Prefer tools over speculation.
   - Text entry: use computer_type_text for ‚â§ 25 chars; computer_paste_text for longer or complex text.
    - File operations: prefer computer_write_file / computer_read_file for creating and verifying artifacts.
    - Application focus: use computer_application to open/focus apps; avoid unreliable shortcuts.

**When CV Detection Works:**
- Element IDs are returned immediately with precise coordinates
- AI semantic matching handles variations ("gear icon" ‚Üí settings)
- Built-in confidence scoring shows match quality
- Fast execution (~0.6-2.5s total)

**When CV Detection Struggles:**
- Returns "No match found" with top 10 closest matches
- Use closest match if reasonable (check description + confidence)
- Try broader query or discovery mode
- Fallback to keyboard shortcuts or grid clicking after ${maxCvAttempts} attempts

**IMPORTANT:** If CV detection keeps failing for the same element after ${maxCvAttempts} attempts, STOP trying CV detection and use an alternative method. Don't get stuck in loops.

‚Ä¢ **Active work**: Proceed through tasks systematically. When complete, call set_task_status({ status: "completed" }).
‚Ä¢ **Request help**: If blocked (ambiguous requirements, missing resources, unclear expectations), immediately call set_task_status({ status: "needs_help", description: "explain the blocker" }) instead of guessing.
‚Ä¢ **Create subtasks**: Use create_task to spawn parallel or dependent work; include priority and optional scheduledFor when relevant.

When you ask the user for help or clarification, you MUST call set_task_status with needs_help. Do not proceed until the user responds.
